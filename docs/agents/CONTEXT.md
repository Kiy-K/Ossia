## Subagents

Ossia has **7 sync subagents** (delegated via the `task` tool) and **3 async
subagents** (long-running, non-blocking via `AsyncSubAgentMiddleware`).

### Sync subagents

| Subagent | What it does | When to delegate |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| `code-researcher` | Read code, find symbols, and map repo structure | When the main agent needs a file path, snippet, or architectural map without filling context |
| `bug-diagnostician` | Investigate a reported bug, failing test, or runtime error | When the main agent needs structured diagnostic output (not a fix) |
| `fix-proposer` | Propose a code change or implementation strategy | After a diagnosis is in hand; produces a minimal concrete patch summary |
| `test-runner` | Run tests, check coverage, or validate a proposed patch | When the main agent needs empirical evidence the change is safe |
| `ui-debugger` | Analyze UI screenshots, browser errors, and stacktrace images | When the user uploads a screenshot of a bug, error, or unexpected UI state |
| `diagram-analyzer` | Parse architecture diagrams, flowcharts, and system dependency graphs | When the user needs structural understanding of a visual system diagram |
| `visual-regression-reviewer` | Compare before/after UI screenshots for regressions | When the user provides a pair of images for visual diff analysis |

All sync subagents receive `[search_codebase, search_knowledge_base]` tools
and the same model as the main agent. They return concise summaries (200-250
word limit) — raw tool outputs are stripped to keep main agent context clean.

### Async subagents

| Subagent | What it does | When to launch |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| `researcher` | In-depth codebase research and repo-wide analysis | For broad searches, architectural mapping, and dependency tracing that would take many turns inline |
| `tester` | Run test suites and validation pipelines | For long test runs, coverage analysis, and flaky test detection that should not block the conversation |
| `auditor` | Repository audits and indexing tasks | For comprehensive codebase audits, lint sweeps, and batch analysis jobs |

Async subagents run via `AsyncSubAgentMiddleware`. The supervisor starts them,
checks progress, and retrieves results without blocking. Each spec maps to a
`graph_id` registered in `langgraph.json` (see graph architecture below).

---

## Graph architecture (langgraph.json)

The `langgraph.json` registers 4 graphs for LangGraph Platform deployments:

```
langgraph.json → supervisor → src/core/graphs/supervisor.py
               → researcher → src/core/graphs/researcher.py
               → tester     → src/core/graphs/tester.py
               → auditor    → src/core/graphs/auditor.py
```

All 4 call `core.agent.build_agent()` and produce identical compiled agents.
They exist so the async subagent middleware can route `start_async_task("researcher")`
to a registered graph_id. When running locally via `uvicorn core.api:app`,
`langgraph.json` is not used — the agent is built in-process.

---

## Tools

All 14 tools registered via `create_core_tools()`:

### Search & Research
- **`search_codebase`** — Search the local project codebase for tokens, symbols, error strings. Prefer over internet_search for anything inside the project.
- **`search_knowledge_base`** — Search local KB for project-specific docs, known issues, troubleshooting guides. Falls back to DuckDuckGo.
- **`internet_search`** — Web search via Tavily (with DuckDuckGo fallback). Use for external API docs, releases, vendor pages.
- **`fetch_url`** — Extract content from a known URL. Supports focused Q&A via `question=` parameter.
- **`qna_search`** — One-shot answer to "what is X?" questions. Single string, no citations.

### Code Change & Validation
- **`run_tests`** — Run tests to verify changes don't break existing functionality.
- **`propose_fix`** — Produce a concrete code fix suggestion from a diagnosed bug.
- **`fetch_issue`** — Fetch a GitHub issue or PR by repo and number.
- **`create_pr`** — Create a GitHub pull request with proposed changes.

### Quality & Delivery
- **`grade_response`** — Self-check draft response quality. Capped at 3 revisions by middleware.
- **`send_response`** — Deliver final approved response. Triggers HITL interrupt when configured.

### Orchestrator Pipelines
- **`run_bugfix_pipeline`** — End-to-end automated bug-fix: diagnose → propose → test.
- **`run_audit_pipeline`** — Comprehensive code audit: research → findings → report.
- **`run_refactor_pipeline`** — Automated code refactoring: research → plan → rewrite → validate.

---

## Key Capabilities

### Multimodal
Ossia accepts images (screenshots, diagrams, UI comparisons) via the
`ChatRequest.artifacts` field. Artifacts are normalized into LangChain content
blocks and passed to the agent context. Subagents (`ui-debugger`,
`diagram-analyzer`, `visual-regression-reviewer`) receive multimodal content
for structured analysis.

### Orchestrator Pipelines
Three programmatic pipelines (`bugfix`, `audit`, `refactor`) expose JavaScript
code via the `CodeInterpreterMiddleware` that uses `task()` to chain subagents.
Each pipeline returns JS code + instruction; the agent executes via `eval()`.

### Skills
Two SKILL.md files loaded via `SkillsMiddleware`:
- `docs/skills/web-search/SKILL.md` — Web search best practices, tool selection guide
- `docs/skills/code-review/SKILL.md` — Code review checklist and output format

Skills use progressive disclosure: metadata (name + description) is in the
system prompt; full content loads on demand via filesystem tools.

### Context Engineering
- **System prompt** loaded from `src/core/prompts/system.md` via `__file__`-relative path
- **Memory** — `/memories/AGENTS.md` seeded in LangGraph Store for cross-thread persistence
- **Dynamic prompt** — `@dynamic_prompt` middleware injects caller identity hash into every model call
- **Context compression** — built-in offloading (large tool I/O saved to filesystem) and summarization (old messages compacted at 85% context limit)
- **Runtime context** — `OssiaContext` (caller, request_id, provider) passed per-invoke, propagates to subagents

---

## Docker compose

`docker compose up -d --build` starts:
- **ossia** — the FastAPI agent server (port 8000 internal)
- **postgres** — state persistence, HITL checkpointing
- **caddy** — reverse proxy on port 80/443 (auto HTTPS via Let's Encrypt)

With `--profile monitoring`:
- **prometheus** — metrics collection (15s interval, 30d retention)
- **loki** — log aggregation (filesystem storage)
- **grafana** — pre-configured dashboards (port 3000, admin/ossia)

The stack uses internal Docker networking (`ossia-net` bridge). All inter-service
communication stays on the internal network.

---

## Monitoring

Prometheus scrapes `/metrics` from the ossia container every 15s. The endpoint
is exposed by `prometheus_fastapi_instrumentator` (added in `core/api.py`).

The Grafana dashboard (11 panels, auto-provisioned) includes:
- Request rate and HTTP status code distribution
- Latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rate tracking
- Log explorer (Loki datasource)
- CPU and memory usage
- Service uptime

Grafana datasources and dashboards are auto-provisioned on startup via
`monitoring/grafana/` config files — no manual setup needed.

---

## Deployment

Three deployment paths:

| Path | Command | Use case |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Docker compose** | `make docker-up` | Local dev, single-server prod |
| **Raw uvicorn** | `uvicorn core.api:app` | Dev, debugging |
| **LangGraph Platform** | `make docker-langgraph-build` | Async subagent infrastructure (EXPERIMENTAL) |

The Docker approach is recommended for production. Caddy provides automatic
HTTPS and security headers. Set `DOMAIN=your.domain` in `.env` for certs.
